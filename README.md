# `ckuhl.github.io`

A strange static website written using Pollen, by way of Racket.

A mystery for all parties involved, including myself.

It's tempting to ask "Why use Racket when it's obscure and obtuse, and the
answer is an unsatisfying 'because it's obscure and obtuse.'" When anything is
possible and everything is a competition, sometimes joy can be found in
creating something no one else would _want_ to create.

## To-do list (i.e. things that may never get done)
- Add more pages (content?)
    - Blog, content pages in subdirectories?
- Document exactly how Pollen works
    - Or at least, well enough that I understand it
