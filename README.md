# Chris Kuhl's Personal Site

A strange static website written using Pollen, by way of Racket.

A mystery for all parties involved, including myself.

It's tempting to ask "Why use Racket when it's obscure and obtuse, and the
answer is an unsatisfying 'because it's obscure and obtuse.'" When anything is
possible and everything is a competition, sometimes joy can be found in
creating something no one else would _want_ to create.


## Structure

If you're unfamiliar with Pollen sites (i.e. a normal human), the basic structure is:

- Structure roughly reflects project structure
- `./src/*` is the pollen site
- `Makefile` does the needful


## To-do list (i.e. things that may never get done)
- Add more pages (content?)
    - Blog, content pages in subdirectories?
    - Arrange in a certain booklike fashion
    - Document exactly how Pollen works
        - Or at least, well enough that I understand it
- More totally radical 88x31px footer images
